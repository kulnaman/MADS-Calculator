# MADS-Calculator

Calculator application for Android based on MADS rule.

MADS Rule:
Contrary to typical BODMAS rule followed in solving mathematical operations everywhere, we
are introducing a new rule (solely for this test). In case of MADS rule, we assume the
mathematical operator ‘(‘ or ‘)’ is not used, and instead we only use operators ‘+, -, *, /’. Where
the precedence of the operators are in the order of MADS - M (*) > A(+) > D(/) > S(-). Hence
you should apply the multiplication operator first, and then the addition and so on. If there are
more than one instance of an operator left most one takes precedence. Few examples:
● 50 + 20 / 10 = 7
○ you first add 50 and 20, which is 70 and then divide by 10 which is 7
○ Because in MADS, A takes precedence over D
